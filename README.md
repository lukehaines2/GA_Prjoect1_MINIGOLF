                    **MINI GOLF**
*******************************************************

This is our first major project in the 3rd week of WDI.
<br>

The technologies used are primarily:<br>

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript (vanilla)
* jQuery (Library)
* External libraries (fonts, additional functionality etc)

My game is intended to be a basic version of the well known game of mini-golf.

The primary objective is to utilise as many of the skills accuired over the last 2 weeks as possible and to effectively implement them to create this game.

Instructions:

Simple! Drag and rotate the ball in the direction you want it to travel, and let it go!

Hope you enjoy!
