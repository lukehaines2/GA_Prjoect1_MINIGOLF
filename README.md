###Overview
This is our first major project in the **3rd week of WDI**.
My game is intended to be a basic version of the well known game of **mini-golf**.

The primary objective is to utilise as many of the skills accuired over the last 2 weeks as possible and to effectively implement them to create this game.

Simple! Drag and rotate the ball in the direction you want it to travel, and let it go!

Hope you enjoy!
