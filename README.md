###Overview
This was my first major project in the **3rd week of WDI**. My game is a basic version of the well known game of Mini Golf. The primary objective of the project is to utilise as many of the skills accuired over the last 2 weeks as possible and to effectively implement them to create this game.

###The Build

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* External libraries (fonts, additional functionality etc)

**Instructions:**

Simple! Drag and rotate the ball in the direction you want it to travel, and let it go! 
The amount of shots is logged, and when it goes in the hole the user is met with an alert to confirm success.

###Problems & Challenges
I really struggled to apply animation libraries to the purposes of my indiviudal project, which subsequently meant taking on the challenge of creating the golf ball animation with pure Vanilla Javascript and using some fairly complex maths! Accomplishing	this	without	using	jQuery,	CSS3	or	Canvas	animations	was	as	tough	as	it	was rewarding,	and	it	really	helped	me	practice	the	process	of	approaching complex logic	problems.

### MVP 2
* Create collisions when the ball hits the walls of the course 
* Have different levels
* Implement game sounds with Soundboard

Hope you enjoy!
