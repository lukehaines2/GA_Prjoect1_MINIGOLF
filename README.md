                          **MINI GOLF**
******************************************************************
+
+This is our first major project in the 3rd week of WDI.
+
+The technologies used are:
+
+* HTML 5
+* CSS 3
+* JavaScript (vanilla)
+* jQuery (Library)
+
+My game is intended to be a basic version of the well known game of animated mini-golf. 
+
+The primary objective is to utilise as many of the skills accuired over the last 2 weeks as possible and to effectively implement them to create this game.
+
+Hope you enjoy!
